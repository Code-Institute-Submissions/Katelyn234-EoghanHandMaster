<h1>Eoghan Hand</h1>
<p>This website is being built to showcase the portfolio of an Irish Freelance Filmmaker. The comprehensive site is designed to display the range of skills this Filmmaker has to offer while showcasing a repertoire of videos and a Gallery of ‘At-work” stills, as well as have a contact tool for collaborations and commissions. As this is a niche area of work, the target audience for this site is very specific. Our audience for this site ranges from creative directors/ producers, corporate marketers, to studio managers and funding bodies; all of whom would consider the website an overall representation of the Filmmaker, therefore it must be well organised, well presented, display appropriate information and be easily accessible. Overall design of the site will be minimalistic to highlight the work and sleek in design at the request of the client (filmmaker).
At present the website is needed for a small number of reasons, but it can be expanded for future purposes and modified to the filmmaker’s business needs.
